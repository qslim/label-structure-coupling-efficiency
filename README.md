This is the code of the paper "Label-Structure Coupling Efficiency: A Principled Framework for Designing Expressive Graph Neural Networks".

The implementation is based on [Specformer](https://github.com/DSL-Lab/Specformer) and [PDF](https://github.com/qslim/PDF).

### Usage
1. Configure hyper-parameters in [config.yaml](config.yaml);
2. Run [preprocessing.py](preprocessing.py) to generate .pt files for each dataset;
3. Run [main.py](main.py) to train the model.
